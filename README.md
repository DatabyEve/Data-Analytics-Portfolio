### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [PWC POWER BI]  
Tools Used: Excel | Power BI  

Description: PwC Power BI on Forage, was designed to enhance data visualization and business intelligence skills. In this project, I worked with real-world business data to transform raw information into meaningful insights using Power BI. The experience involved data cleaning with Excel, preparation and analysis, followed by the creation of interactive dashboards and reports. Through this process, I identified key performance indicators (KPIs) and business trends, applying data storytelling techniques to communicate insights effectively. This project strengthened my ability to analyze data, visualize trends and present findings in a way that supports data-driven decision-making.
